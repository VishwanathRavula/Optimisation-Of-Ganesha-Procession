# Optimisation-of-Ganesha-Procession
Ganesha Chavithi is one of the most important
religious festivals conducted through out India which includes
Ganesha procession followed by Ganesha immersion. This pro-
cession leads to high traffic congestion which in-turn leads
to disruption in routine activities of the citizens. This paper
discusses about the various approaches that can be applied so
that the traffic congestion can be minimized and thus resulting
in comfort of common people. In this paper, we proposed a
novel algorithm based on shortest distance for clustering and
optimized MST algorithm for finding optimal path for each
cluster of Ganeshas to itâ€™s Lake. and have also shown the results
as implemented on google maps.
